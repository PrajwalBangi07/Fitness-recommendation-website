          <h2>YOGA BASICS</h2>
          <p>Yoga is an ancient Indian sanathani tradition that dates back thousands of years.
            Yoga originated in India and is deeply rooted in its cultural and spiritual heritage.
            It encompasses physical, mental, and spiritual practices aimed at achieving holistic well-being.
            The word "yoga" is derived from the Sanskrit word "yuj," which means to unite or join.
            Yoga seeks to unite the individual self (Atman) with the universal consciousness (Brahman).
            The practice involves physical postures (asanas) to promote flexibility and strength.
            Breath control (pranayama) is a fundamental aspect of yoga, aiding in relaxation and focus.
            Meditation and mindfulness are integral to yoga, helping individuals attain inner peace and self-realization.</p>
