          <h2>SERENITY AND STRENGTH</h2>
          <p>Strengthening exercises are crucial for building muscle and improving overall fitness.
            These exercises target specific muscle groups to increase their size and endurance.
            Common strengthening exercises include weightlifting, resistance training, and bodyweight exercises.
            Weightlifting involves lifting free weights or using machines to challenge muscles.
            Resistance bands and exercise equipment like dumbbells are often used in these workouts.
            Regular strengthening exercises can enhance bone density and prevent muscle loss.
            They play a vital role in improving posture and reducing the risk of injury.
            Incorporating a variety of exercises into a routine helps achieve balanced strength throughout the body.</p>
